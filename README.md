# E-ink-monitor-tips-and-trics

My experience with Dasung Paperlike HD monitor and software, themes and tools that might be usefull when you use Electronic Ink (e-ink) monitor.

As recomended by producer I aslo recomend to use as less as possible white backgrounds (as eink referesh faster white sections and extends monitor lifespan).
Keyboard should be used as much as possible.
